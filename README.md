1. **ID** - Is an unique ID of the device in our DB
2. **Delta Time** - first Delta Time is date of detection, all remaining are intervals(in minutes) between each other.
3. **Direction(in degrees)** - at what angle the radiation particle came
4. **Intensity** - recorded brightness on the matrix
5. **Arrows** - Display previous/next detections. It blocks as you reach last or first detection correspondingly
